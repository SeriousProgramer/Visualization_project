## Overview
This project is part of the JBI100 course, focusing on data visualization techniques using Python's Dash and Plotly libraries. The project comprises several interactive web pages that allow users to explore and analyze various aspects of financial data, including credit scores, loans, debts, and occupation-related statistics.

## Installation
To run the project, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
- Dash
- Plotly
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy

You can install these packages using pip.


## Usage
Run the main Dash app file (app.py) to start the web server. Once the server is running, you can access the visualizations through your web browser.

## Features
The project includes several interactive dashboards with features such as:
- Dropdown selectors for filtering data
- Heatmaps and scatter plots for analyzing loan data
- Box plots and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots for credit score analysis
- Line graphs for examining debt and income trends across different occupations

## Data
The visualizations are based on credit_score dataset. This dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed for optimal visualization results.
